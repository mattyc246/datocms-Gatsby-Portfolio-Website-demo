I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and I started my software journey back in 2018.</p>\n<p>I am currently a Mentor at NEXT Academy, Malaysia, teaching the next wave of budding young coders so they can make their first steps into the wonderful world of Software Development.</p>\n<p>I started my journey with Ruby and Ruby-On-Rails and I then ventured off into React and Python as the main language/library that I code. Currently, I would say I am more of a <strong>backend developer</strong> than I am a <strong>frontend developer</strong> but I am continously improving on my design and UI skills to be a better frontend developer (anyone who codes knows how difficult frontend can be hahaha).</p>\n<p>I am always open to learning new technologies as I try and find the stacks that I love and enjoy coding in the most. In my eyes, when you love what you do, that's when you truly excel in it.</p>\n<p>If you would like to know more about me, you can go and checkout my blog for my more in depth introduction to myself.</p>\n<p>But for now, I shall leave it there.</p>\n<p>Thanks,\nMatt :)</p>"}},"techStackBioNode":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Here are the current technology stacks I am working with or I am familiar with.
