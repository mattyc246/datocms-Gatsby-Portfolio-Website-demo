After completing 2 years, I decided to drop out for a couple of reasons. One being that there were some issues with my course (won't go into details on that but it was very demotivating), secondly, I had a chance to work here in an automotive performance workshop doing what I had dreamed of doing my whole life.</p>\n<p>After spending 4 going on 5 years working in that industry, I realised while my passion lied with fast cars, it wasn't a career I wanted to continue pursuing as the aspect of work and hobby were starting to lose touch.</p>\n<p>I decided to make a leap of faith and pursue a new career as a Software Developer. Growing up I had always been the sort of person that enjoys building things with my own two hands and mind. It was a no brainer given that I also enjoy technology, design and engineering things. I attended a bootcamp at <a href=\"https://www.nextacademy.com\">NEXT Academy</a> to pursue my career in tech. Having graduated, I immediately took a job as a mentor at NEXT Academy, teaching the next wave of students coming through the ranks.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, I have fallen in love with Web Development, Software Development and any other names it may go by, there is a real sense of achievement seeing the things created with your fingertips and mind, come to fruition.</p>\n<p>The hunger for knowledge will never stop with software, nor will the evolution of technology and need for it in all aspects of life. So, here's to a long future in the software development world and driving the next generation of website, applications and software.</p>"}},"techStackBioNode":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Here are the current technology stacks I am working with or I am familiar with.
